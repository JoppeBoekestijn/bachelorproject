NOTES:
	- Softmax normalizes the estimates that comes from the fully-connected layer
	- Argmax returns the index of the highest element in vector
	- Cross entropy matches the real labels with the predicted ones, if they are equal cross entropy is equal to zero
		- Uses logits, with softmax added
		- You want to have the cross entropy for all images combined so you take the reduce_mean
	- AdamOptimizer is an advanced form of Gradient Descent

TO DO:
DATASET:
	- Move validation data into train dataset, load in both the validation
	data and the train data, with only 10 classes


WRITE DOWN ARCHITECTURE CHOICES:
	- Why and which activation function? (ReLu)
	- What function to normalize? (softmax)
	- What cost function? (cross entropy)
	- What optimizer? (AdamOptimizer)
